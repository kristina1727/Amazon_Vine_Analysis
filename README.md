# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. Vine members receive product from vendors who wish to have their product reviewed by these trusted individuals based on how helpful their reviews on other similar products. 

I chose to conduct my analysis on the Pet Product reviews.

## Results

**Vine Reviews**
There are a total of 170 reviews completed for various pet products. Out of the 170 reviews, 65 of them were 5-star reviews. Meaning 38% of the reviews completed by Vine members had a 5-star review.

**Non-Vine Reviews**
There were significantly more non-vine reviews completed at 37,840! Of those 37,340 reviews, 20,612 gave a 5-star rating. This means that 55% of the non-Vine reviews had 5-stars.

## Summary
I think it is safe to conclude based on the analysis completed and as shown in the images above that there is not pay positivity bias for the reviews in the vine program. I would suspect the opposite. One could assume that those non-Vine reviews are more positive as those individuals ordering the products have a need and/or want for those products whereas the Vine members may not. 

An additional analysis one could conduct to further dive into this is to look at the product_id to determine if some products are being rated more favorably than other. If the data was available, one could even look at the price of the product to see if the overall price of the product Vine members received affected the rating provided.
